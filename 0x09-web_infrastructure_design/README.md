# Web infrastructure design

This project is a demonstration of knowledge I gained in web infrastructure design. Not only did I conduct research on different design principles but also whiteboarded diagrams of a developing web infrastructure. I started with a simple LAMP model and ended with a fully distributed, monitored, and secured system.

All files in this project contain links to each respective whiteboard diagram.
